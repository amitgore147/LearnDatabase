To enhance my overall experience, clearer and more consistent communication around project requirements would be beneficial. Early involvement in project planning and more structured requirements gathering would help reduce rework and allow me to deliver more efficiently. Additionally, implementing a more formalized approach to handling requirement changes, like a change request process, would improve overall workflow and reduce last-minute disruptions. More regular feedback and check-ins on my progress would also help ensure alignment and foster continuous improvement

My manager should continue fostering an open and supportive communication environment. Regular check-ins and constructive feedback have been invaluable in helping me understand expectations and improve my performance. Additionally, I appreciate their encouragement for professional development, such as supporting my participation in training programs like the ACON Bridge program. Continuing to prioritize team collaboration and recognizing individual contributions will help maintain a positive team dynamic and motivate us to achieve our goals."
