In response to the question "What could have been better?" and considering the issue of unclear and changing requirements in your project, you could frame your response like this:

"One area that could have been improved was the clarity and stability of project requirements. Frequently, the requirements were not fully defined at the outset, and changes were introduced after development had begun. This led to rework and delays in meeting deadlines. Moving forward, I believe we could benefit from more structured requirement gathering and clear documentation before starting development. Additionally, implementing a more formal change management process could help minimize disruptions and ensure that changes are handled efficiently."

This highlights the challenge while showing a constructive approach to improving the process.
